  <h2>Project 2: Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization</h2>
  <p><strong>Student:</strong> Aryslanbek Vakilov — UCSD Email: avakilov@ucsd.edu</p>

  <h3>Proposition</h3>
  <p><strong>"High income growth among the bottom 40% of the population does not always result in reduced poverty or lower inequality."</strong></p>
  <hr>

  <h2>FOR the P roposition</h2>
  <img src="images/Plot_1.png" alt="High Income Growth ≠ Low Poverty Chart">
  <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> High Income Growth ≠ Low Poverty. This chart shows that even countries with rapid income growth among the bottom 40% can still struggle with high poverty levels.</p>
 </article>
  <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Transformation (Score = +1.5 Earnest):</strong> Filtered the data to the top 15 countries with the highest bottom-40% growth rates. This focuses attention on countries often seen as economic “success stories,” revealing that poverty can still remain high even in fast-growing economies.</li>
    <li><strong>Color Encoding (Score = +2 Earnest):</strong> Used a blue-to-orange gradient to represent poverty headcount, making differences visually clear without distortion. Warmer tones draw attention to countries with greater poverty.</li>
    <li><strong>Title Framing (Score = -0.5 Slightly Deceptive):</strong> The title “High Income Growth ≠ Low Poverty” intentionally provokes skepticism about economic growth. The wording creates a persuasive tone without overt bias.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>AGAINST the Proposition</h2>
  <img src="images/Plot_2.png" alt="Inequality Persists Even as Poverty Declines Chart">
  <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Inequality Persists Even as Poverty Declines. This dual-axis chart shows that while poverty levels may fall, inequality (as measured by the Gini Index) often remains high.</p>

  <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dual-Axis Encoding (Score = -1 Mildly Deceptive):</strong> Displayed poverty rates on the left axis and Gini Index on the right axis. This combination encourages comparison but can introduce interpretive bias through scale differences.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Transformation (Score = +1.5 Earnest):</strong> Averaged values over several years to reduce noise and show broader trends in poverty and inequality rather than year-to-year fluctuations.</li>
    <li><strong>Color and Line Styles (Score = +2 Earnest):</strong> Contrasting colors (red for inequality and blue for poverty) make the relationship clear at a glance and draw attention to the gap between declining poverty and persistent inequality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>About the Gini Index</h3>
  <p>The Gini Index measures income inequality within a country on a scale from 0 (perfect equality) to 100 (maximum inequality). Including the Gini Index alongside poverty rates reveals whether economic growth benefits all citizens or mainly the wealthier segments of society. It is helpful for understanding how countries can reduce poverty while still struggling with inequality.</p>

  <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  <p>Working on this project helped me see how design choices influence the stories that data tells. Creating two visualizations for opposite sides of the same idea showed me that the difference between being persuasive and being misleading can be very small. In one chart, I highlighted cases where growth didn’t reduce poverty, while in the other, I tried to show broader progress over time. Both were built from the same data, but each told a very different story.</p>

  <p>The most challenging part was balancing clarity with fairness. I realized that even small choices like changing a title, color, or axis scale can strongly influence how people interpret results. Designing ethically means being honest about what the data shows while still making it engaging and easy to understand.</p>
  <p>To me, ethical visualization is about intent and transparency. It’s fine to guide the viewer’s attention, but not to hide context or distort meaning. Persuasive visuals are ethical when they aim to inform clearly, not manipulate. This project reminded me that as data visualizers, we have a responsibility to tell stories that are accurate, fair, and thoughtful.</p>
